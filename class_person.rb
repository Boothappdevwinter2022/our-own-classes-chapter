# Define a class Person with:

#  - An attribute first_name
#  - An attribute last_name
#  - An attribute birthdate (we just assign a string to this attribute, e.g. "April 19, 1987")
#  - An instance method, full_name, that puts first_name and last_name together
#  - An instance method, age, that calculates the number of years between today and birthdate

class Person
  attr_accessor :first_name
  attr_accessor :last_name
  attr_accessor :birthdate

  def full_name
    return self.first_name + " " + self.last_name
  end

  def age
    require "date"
    dob = Date.parse(self.birthdate)
    #change the formula to diff in year because that's how the unit test was defined
    age = Date.today.year - dob.year
    return age
  end
end
